# SQL MCP Chat OpenRouter

Standalone Spring AI proof of concept for OpenRouter chat models and a local Microsoft Data API Builder MCP server.

## Verified Setup Choices

- Java: 21
- Spring Boot: 4.1.1
- Spring AI BOM: 2.0.1
- Base package: `com.example.sqlmcpchatopenrouter`
- MCP transport: Streamable HTTP, configured through `.env`
- Chat provider: Spring AI OpenAI-compatible starter, pointed at OpenRouter

## Local Configuration

Runtime values are loaded from the local `.env` file via Spring Boot config import.
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` locally and fill in your own values. The real `.env`
file is ignored by git and should not be committed.

Required values:

```properties
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
TOKEN_SECRET_KEY=...
DAB_MCP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001
OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER=http://localhost:8080
ECOM_MSSQL_CONNECTION_STRING=...
```

Other settings such as the model names, MCP endpoint path, completion limit, temperature, and log level have defaults in `application.yml`; add them to `.env` only when overriding locally.

For a responsive local POC, use the prompt-enforced JSON mode with a 30-second model timeout and leave the primary
retry disabled:

```properties
APP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30s
APP_RESPONSE_FORMAT=prompt_json
APP_PRIMARY_RETRY_ENABLED=false
```

The default execution flow is `primary -> fallback`. Set `APP_PRIMARY_RETRY_ENABLED=true` only when the extra latency
of `primary -> retry primary -> fallback` is acceptable. In the default `prompt_json` mode, the schema is supplied in
the prompt and the final response is still parsed into the typed response contract. Set
`APP_RESPONSE_FORMAT=json_schema` only for a model that reliably supports the OpenAI JSON Schema response format.

## Secret Management

- Keep local secrets only in `.env`.
- Commit `.env.example` with placeholder values so other machines know which keys are required.
- Use GitHub Actions repository secrets for CI/CD variables instead of committing keys.
- Rotate `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` immediately if it is ever pasted into chat, logs, screenshots, or git history.
- Generate `TOKEN_SECRET_KEY` as a long random value and keep it stable for one local environment.
- Supply the SQL setup script's reader password with sqlcmd, for example
  `sqlcmd -v ECOM_DAB_READER_PASSWORD="..." -i dab/ecommerce/setup-ecommerce.sql`.
- Configure `ECOM_MSSQL_CONNECTION_STRING` with `User Id=ecom_dab_reader`; do not run DAB with `sa`
  or another write-capable database identity.

## Current API

Open the chat UI:

```bash
open http://localhost:8080/
```

List DAB MCP tools discovered through Spring AI's Streamable HTTP MCP client:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/mcp/tools
```

Send a chat request with DAB MCP tools available to the model:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"List the available database entities.","conversationId":"demo"}'
```

Stream chat progress as browser SSE:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat/stream \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"List the available database entities.","conversationId":"demo"}'
```

Clear in-memory chat history for a conversation:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/conversations/demo/memory
```

## Runtime Flow

```text
ChatController -> ChatCoordinator -> PII guard -> Spring AI ChatClient
               -> conversation memory -> guarded DAB MCP tools -> SQL Server
               -> typed ChatResponse -> PII output guard -> UI
```

Inbound email, phone, and explicitly identified customer-name values are pseudonymized before
they reach OpenRouter. Sensitive DAB result fields are pseudonymized at the tool-callback boundary
before the model sees them. The application stores chat memory explicitly only after input
protection and structured-output redaction; it does not use `MessageChatMemoryAdvisor`, which can
otherwise capture raw model output before application-level redaction. Responses retain stable
pseudonyms such as `CU_a3f9d2`, while entity tables include non-sensitive database IDs for reliable
follow-ups. Raw PII and the request-scoped token map are not persisted.

The POC has no end-user authentication or per-user authorization. DAB mutation tools are
disabled and database access should use the `ecom_dab_reader` login created by the setup script.

## Isolation

This project is intentionally independent and does not reference the existing `sql-mcp-chat` project.
